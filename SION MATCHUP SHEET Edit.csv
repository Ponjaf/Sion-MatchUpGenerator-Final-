Aatrox,Lose,Tank,Hard,try and juke the sweet spots of his Q and only charge your Q when he has no way of ccing you anymore only take quick trades 
Akali,Win,Tank,easy,never charge Q if you dont have minion in front of you to protect you from her E if she ulties you then ulty away so she ulties with her 2nd R into your ult if you can then take long trades dont be afraid to brute force her down and just auto her to death you win long trades
Camille,skill,Doesnt matter,Hard,kite and outrange her with your range after she went in with E never try to ult away since she will just ult you and mess you up W her W so you block a lot of dmg but still doesnt break it so you get dmg off aswell on your W 
Cassiopeia,Win ,Lethality,Medium,dont walk up and Q unless its a guranteed knockup and that you can dissengage after since she can just Q and kill you if she wont get knocked up burn her F before lvl 6 (probably you will die doing it) then at lvl 6 just E into R her and you win
Cho'Gath,Win,Doesnt matter,Medium,walk up and Q him and if he uses his W to interrupt you then let him interrupt but if he uses his Q to interrupt then release your Q at the last second never let him auto you he cant kill you so just farm and outscale (can kill him early game)
Darius,Lose,Doesnt matter,Impossible,Goddamn broken champ you can't win trades against this champion can be considered as a ban if it is often pick in your elo
Diana,Win,Doesnt matter,Easy,poke her down with Q even if you were to die in this matchup you will most likely kill her in passive
Dr. Mundo,Win,Doesnt matter,Easy,you have kill potential early game but later just looking to farm up and outscale if you would die early game then just kill him in the passive
Fiora,Skill,Tank,Hard,mindgames with her W and your Q. In early game only do fast Q (no knockup) then when you got serrated dirk and some lvls you can charge it fully but she has to parry early or else she wins so be careful a combo to gurantee fully charge is to let her dash on you then ult her melee range into q charge this will make her panic and do fast parry but then you just hold your Q and she parries nothing basically buy a bramble vest
Gangplank,Win,Doesnt matter,Medium,you win by poking him down with Q but only if you dodge his barrels and never let him auto you otherwise you lose look to kill him in your passive whenever you die. Dont proxy vs gp
Garen,Win,Doesnt matter,Easy,poke him down with Q never let him get in melee range of you E him after he uses his Q not before

Illaoi,Win,Lethality,Medium,juke her E if her E is down just walk up slow her and fully charge Q. if you expect that she will try and ult you just charge your Q she will think she can time it to dodge the cc but 99% of the times they misstime it if you do it fully charge and then you can just release it and run away
Irelia,Lose,Tank,Hard,sit at your turret can only try and trade with her when she doesnt have minions to dash on/5stacks on her passive. 
Jax,Lose,Tank,Hard,force the wave to be at your turret not his wait with all your cds untill he went in on you and his e is down then you can fully charge him
Jayce,Win,Doesnt matter,Medium,care early game lvl 6 E into R him. pre charge your Q so he might jump on you and you interrupt him mid air (if you start charge too late he will just jump on you and e you before youre able to knock him up)
Kalista,Lose,Tank,Impossible,stay back and hope to get help dont charge Q since she just jumps out of it better to hold it so she has to respect it
Karma,Win,Lethality,Easy,litteraly free lane just slow her into Q or R and you insta win
Kayle,Win,Lethality,Easy,only way she beats you is if she dodge your Q so always slow her before chargin it dont be afraid to E into R even if she ulties your ulty you will still get a fully charged Q so she dies anyways 
Kennen,Win,Lethality,Easy,try and bait his E by walking up and charging Q on him your Q will be back up a lot fast so then you can either E into R or E into Q and it should be a free kill. care his early game tho since its hard killing him in the passive
Kled,Skill,Doesnt matter,Hard,dont ever be melee range when he is about to dismount. dont E into Q in this matchup you just want to Q so that you can interrupt his E if you E into Q this is rarely going to work.  make it a short lane so he cant run you down (minions at your turret)

Renekton,Win,Tank,Medium,just a stronger laner he will beat you even if you outplay him so just farm up and outscale.

Tryndamere,Win,Tank,Hard,make it a short lane (minions at your turret not his) never charge your Q unless youre from max range or his E is down. You win by kiting if he uses his e to engage just slow him move out of melee range and get a good Q off
Urgot,Win,Doesnt matter,Medium,never let him get on-top of you cancel his E with your Q by releasing it as soon as he starts moving not as soon as he uses the abillity (then he will get cced but will still go through with his E)
Vayne,Skill,Lethality,Hard,you win by getting fully charges from a bush/fog of war or if she uses her Q then you have a small window to E into R her. if you cant do any of these things then youre going to end up losing
